<h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

<p>
The Personal Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented by an assessment result, called <em>ring assignment</em>. Four rings are used with the following semantics:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies I have high confidence in to serve a purpose, also in large scale production environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.</li>
<li><strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that I have seen work with success in project work to solve a real problem; first serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky.</li>
<li><strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising and have clear potential value-add; technologies worth to invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often brand new and highly unproven.</li>
<li><strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be used for new projects. Technologies that are not (yet) worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

<p>
Navigating the ever-evolving technology landscape demands a strategic balance between embracing emerging technologies and leveraging stable, production-ready ones. A personal technology radar, embodying both hands-on experience and forward-thinking insights, serves as a strategic tool for assessing risks and rewards inherent in the adoption of various technologies. This disciplined approach not only ensures a productive balance for achieving business objectives, but also communicates a deep understanding of the development teams work and challenges, fostering an environment of mutual respect and collaborative problem-solving.
